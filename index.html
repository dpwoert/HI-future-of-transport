				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--first-transcontinental-railroad">
					Before the Transcontinental Railroad was opened, the <span class="number">30,000 miles</span> travel from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast took <span class="number">6 months</span> to complete over land. After the opening the journey only took around <span class="number">7 days</span> <span class="cite">(history.com, 2009)</span>. This made it possible for thousand of migrants to move to the West Coast, creating an increase in trade, business and population. It created the psychological effect of bringing the country together <span class="cite">(The New York Times, 2012)</span>. This phenomena of getting closer together is the subject of this paper. This paper will research which technologies got people closer together in the past, and which technologies will do so in the future.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--suez-canal">
					Before the Suez canal was opened ships had to go round the southern tip of Africa to go to the East Indies and Australia, this journey was <span class="number">6,100 km</span> longer than the new route via the Suez Canal <span class="cite">(Suez Canal Authority, n.d.)</span>. Steamships were burned by the reliance on coal, the further it travel the more space it needs on board to store this coal. This made steamships more expansive than sailing vessels for long distance travels. Since sailing vessels had to use a tug to get through the canal, which was difficult and more expensive than going via Cape of Good Hope, the Suez canal was mainly used by steamships <span class="cite">(Sichko, 2011)</span>. This gave a growth in the manufacturing in steamships to be used for long distances <span class="cite">(MacGregor, 1983)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--immigration">
					Due to several reasons more and more Europeans were chasing their dreams or last hopes by migrating to the United States. This immigration encourages the transition from sails to big steam ocean liners. With traditional sail ships the voyage will take <span class="number">5 to 6 weeks</span>, steam ships shortened this to less than <span class="number">14 days</span>. Steam made it possible for ships to get bigger and faster and thus to transport more and more people over the Atlantic <span class="cite">(Cohn, 2005)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--orient-express">
					Most innovations in travel were only reserved for rich and famous at start, it takes time for the common people to take advantage of the decrease in travel time or extra luxury these innovations brought. The Orient Express was part of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) it was the most international train route at it’s time by connecting <span class="number">13</span> countries and the the journey from Paris to Istanbul lasted a little over <span class="number">80 hours</span> <span class="cite">(Zax, 2007)</span>. For many the Orient Express was a byword for all that was most intriguing, romantic and mysterious about long-distance international train travel <span class="cite">(Lambert, 2013)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--auxiliary-sails">
					The RMS Umbria was the last biggest ship with auxiliary sails. On delivery the RMS Umbria was the biggest ocean liner in the world <span class="cite">(Cunard, n.d.)</div>. This ship still needed the auxiliary sails to cross the Atlantic Ocean, while using steam power as main source.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--wright-brothers">
					The Wright Brothers were the first to fly a heavier than air machine. They flew for <span class="number">12 seconds</span> and covered <span class="number">36 meters</span> on their inaugural flight <span class="cite">(History.com, 2009)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--steam-turbine">
					The RMS Mauretania was on it’s delivery the biggest ocean liner in the world. Until 1911 it was the fastest ship in the world, it could maintain an average of <span class="number">24 knots</span> (<span class="number">44 km/h</span>). This was made possible because it was the first big ship to use the new steam turbine technology <span class="cite">(Maxtone-Graham, 1972)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--model-t">
					Until the introduction of the Model T cars have been around for decades but the Model T was the first mass produced car in the world. Through changing manufacturing from garages to factory belts Henry Ford could reduce the price of the cars. This made it possible for middle-class Americans to buy a car. Until 1927 <span class="number">15 million</span> Model T’s were manufactored <span class="cite">(History.com, 2010)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__content--bus">
					The London General Omnibus Company (L.G.O.C.) B.-type motorbus was the first commercially mass produced bus <span class="cite">(Explore 20th Century London, n.d.)</span>. These busses started replacing the omnibuses, which were still horse drawn.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__diesel-ship">
					The MS Selandia was the first big ship that no longer used coal and steam to move. After removing the sails, the chimneys were now also removed <span class="cite">(MAN SE, n.d.)</span>. The ship was powered by a diesel engine, which was more efficient than coal. Experts calculated the motorship had a <span class="number">40%</span> advantage in fuel costs, with fewer crew and steadier sea speeds <span class="cite">(Dickie, 1922)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__wo-1">
					At the start of World War I motor vehicles had yet to seriously threaten the railways, except for local traffic, while aviation was at an early stage. All armies needed to mobilise and move their soldiers and equipments to the battlefront, this drove innovation in transportation <span class="cite">(Whitmore, n.d.)</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__content timeline__first-atlantic-flight">
					Alcock and Brown were the first to cross the Atlantic in a plane. Planes were still troubled in their radius and reliability, they could only make short hops and would often crash. During their Atlantic flight Alcock and Brown had covered almost <span class="number">3000 km</span> in <span class="number">15 hours</span> and <span class="number">57 minutes</span> <span class="cite">(Flank, 2015)</span>.
